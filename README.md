# The Design Process Quiz Game
Every school, class, program, and teacher has their own variant on the design process. This particular quiz is based on the current model used in BC High Schools. Featuring 30 questions over the 6 stages of this model, this quiz is useful for anyone who is in grade 11 or 12, in BC, and needs to learn that specific model of the design process.
Because the next time you see it, the process will be just different enough that you have to relearn most of it.

Despite that, this project also showcases a simple, object oriented approach to designing a quiz game which could be easily expanded upon to include questions for your specific needs.
